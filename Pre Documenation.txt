Marching Cubes with Dual Contouring

This application will be a  terrane system where you can edit it and save it and load from file, and prefab the mesh to be imported into a game.
This is to mimic early 2000's map editors That is the look and feel I want to achieve 

Apart from Unity and System, there are no extra libraries.

To distribute this project, it will be a unity package with a single prefab that needs to be present in the scene.

The marching cubes algorithm goes through a scalar field of eight neighboring points, these represent a face based on which points are active.
marching the "cube" of eight points gets the polygons, calculates the vertices and the triangles.
