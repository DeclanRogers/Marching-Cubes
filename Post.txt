Matching Cubes Post project

Issues I encountered during this project, I had to calculate normals, but also making it flat shaded so 
removing duplicated vertices so they can share vertices.

I had an issue with chunks having random gaps this is because it is a fence post error

I had an issue where saving wouldn’t save the last value completely, I had to flush it and that solved
that issue.

I swapped out dual contouring and replaced it with Triplanar mapping, this happened because I was running 
low on time and adding more calculation and decreasing performance wasn’t worth it. The project already runs 
poorly when editing terrain.

The performance of the system as stated up above is poor, but at least it only happens when editing terrain, 
editing over chunks is worse. Making bigger maps take a while I would like to learn the Unity jobs system so 
I can spread the creation of chunks over multiple threads and really boost the speed of start-up.
